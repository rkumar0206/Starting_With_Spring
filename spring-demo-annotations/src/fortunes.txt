You’re off to great places, today is your day. Your mountain is waiting, so get on your way.
You always pass failure on the way to success.
No one is perfect - that’s why pencils have erasers.
Winning doesn’t always mean being first. Winning means you’re doing better than you’ve done before.
It always seems impossible until it is done.
Keep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see a shadow.
